Description: Show FIXME/TODO/BUG/KLUDGE in special face in comments
 I saw this question[1] on Stack Overflow asking to highlight FIXME (and
 similar strings) in your code, but only in comments and strings.
 .
 The current fixme-mode.el found on the Emacs Wiki is kind of clunky (it's
 really a major mode) and awkward to read. So I took the challenge to write
 a new minor-mode which answers the question.
 .
 I give you fic-mode.el[2]. It's named fic as an acronym for Fixme In
 Comments.
 .
 Note: the code hasn't been touched since 2010.
